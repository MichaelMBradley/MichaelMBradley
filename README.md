# About Me

I'm a computer science student in my fourth year at Carleton University in Ottawa with a major GPA of 11.68/12.

I recently did a 4 month co-op at Emids as a Software Developer on the Rapid Access Addiction Medication telehealth project.
Before that I worked as a Test Automation & Software Developer at Ross Video for an 8 month co-op term, and then continued to work with them part-time on a research project for 4 months while I studied.

I have experience in Python, TypeScript (React), Java, C, C++, SQL, and more.
