# About Me

I'm a computer science student in my third year at Carleton University in Ottawa with a major CGPA of 11.8/12.

I have experience in Python, Java, C, C++, SQL, TypeScript, and more.

I worked as a Test Automation & Software Developer at Ross Video for an 8 month co-op term, and then continued to work with them part-time for 4 months while I studied.
I'm about to start a 4 month co-op as a Software Developer at Macadamian Technologies.
