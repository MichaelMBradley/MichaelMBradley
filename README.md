# About Me

I'm a computer science student in my fourth year at Carleton University in Ottawa with a major GPA of 11.5/12 (A+).
I have completed all the requirements of the Carleton's Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning computer science stream, and I also have experience with graphics (specifically OpenGL) and game development.

I'll be graduating this fall and I'm looking to start a full time job in February 2025, so if you're hiring for a software developer please take a look at [my CV](https://mmbradley.ca/resume.pdf).

I recently worked as an Embedded Software Development Student on the Sensor Framework at [Blackberry QNX](https://blackberry.qnx.com/).
Before that, did a 4 month co-op at [Emids](https://www.emids.com/) as a Software Developer on the [Rapid Access Addiction Medication](https://www.emids.com/offerings/platforms/healthconnect/inq-digital-front-door/) telehealth project.
At my first co-op I was a Test Automation & Software Developer at [Ross Video](https://www.rossvideo.com/) for an 8 month term, and then continued to work with them part-time on a research project for 4 months while I continued my studies.

I have experience in C, C++, Python, TypeScript, React, Linux and more.
