# About Me

I'm a computer science student in my third year at Carleton University in Ottawa with a major CGPA of 11.8/12.

I've just finished an 8-month co-op as a Test Automation & Software Developer at Ross Video, and I'm continuing to do some part time work for them looking into automatically generating unit tests.

I'm looking for an employer for my upcoming co-op term from May-August 2023, so if anything on my GitHub interests you then feel free to [contact me](mailto:michaelmbrad@gmail.com). I'm a fast learner, and I enjoy solving difficult problems (and Rubik's cubes).
